        <p>A fencepost error (occasionally called a <b>telegraph pole</b> or <b>lamp-post error</b>) is a specific type of off-by-one error. The following problem illustrates the error:</p>
        <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">If you build a straight fence 100 meters long with posts 10 meters apart, how many posts do you need?</div>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The intuitive answer 10 is wrong. The fence has 10 sections, but 11 posts.</p>
        <p>The reverse error occurs when the number of posts is known and the number of sections is assumed to be the same. The actual number of sections is one less than the number of posts.</p>
        <p>More generally, the problem can be stated as follows:</p>
        <blockquote class="templatequote">
        <div class="Bug6200">If you have <i>n</i> telegraph poles, how many gaps are there between them?</div>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The correct answer may be <i>n</i> − 1, <i>n</i>, or <i>n</i> + 1, depending on the conditions. The precise problem definition must be carefully considered, as the setup for one situation may give the wrong answer for other situations. Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row.</p>
        <p>Fencepost errors can also occur in units other than length. For example, the time pyramid, consisting of 120 blocks placed at 10 year intervals between blocks, is scheduled to take 1190 (not 1200) years to build, from the installation of the first block to the last block. One of the earliest fencepost errors involved time, where the Julian calendar originally calculated leap years incorrectly, due to counting inclusively rather than exclusively, yielding a leap year every three years rather than every four.</p>
        <p>"Fencepost error" can, in rare occasions, refer to an error induced by unexpected regularities in input values, which can (for instance) completely thwart a theoretically efficient binary tree or hash function implementation. This error involves the difference between expected and worst case behaviours of an algorithm.</p>
        <p>In larger numbers being off-by-one is often not a major issue. In smaller numbers, however, and specific cases where accuracy is paramount committing an off-by-one error can be disastrous. Sometimes such an issue will also be repeated and, therefore, worsened, by someone passing on an incorrect calculation if the following person makes the same kind of mistake again (of course, the error might also be reversed).</p>
        <p>An example of this error can occur in the computational language Matlab with the <code>linspace()</code> function, whose parameters are (lower value, upper value, number of values) and not (lower value, upper value, number of increments). A programmer who misunderstands the third parameter to be the number of increments might hope that <code>linspace(0,10,5)</code> would achieve a sequence <code>[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code> but instead would get <code>[0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10]</code>.</p>

     <p>Resting his head against the backboard of the hotel bed, Kiyoshi stared at the door to the room. With the comforter bundled up by his feet, leaving only the top sheet to cover him, he controlled his breathing, inhaling and exhaling incredibly slowly. Something within him was bursting, but he firmly held it in check, unwilling to let anything reach the surface.</p>

     <p>How was he supposed to feel about this? These emotions were unfamiliar to him. A century of pain was enough to rob anyone of heartfelt pleasure—even the very memory of it. And now, someone extremely close to him, closer than he had been to nearly anyone, someone whom he feared he might reject with these emotions was evoking them.</p>

     <p>There was no doubt in his heart, mind or soul that what he was experiencing was love, and yet he did not wish to recognize it. To do so might de-evolve him back into the monster he once was, and he would rather fall straight into hell than repeat that past. Love was only a derivative of lust, and lust is candy to the body, but ultimately torture to the soul, his soul.</p>

     <p>And yet, that did not make any sense to him. He did not lust after her. He had not lusted after anyone since his reformation, within his conscious control, and somehow he knew that what he felt for his charge, his new sister, Kimiko was not lust.</p>

     <p>What was it then: a love a father might have for a daughter, a brother for a sister? Or was it something more? Kiyoshi simply did not have the experience to discern the answer to his grave problem. Questioning it only brought him more confusion, so he would need to sort through his feelings, and hopefully shed some light on the situation.</p>
